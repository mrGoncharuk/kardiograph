Cardiocycle and electrocardiogram, builder.

## Description
KardioGraph was developed in science purpose to research and process human electrocardiogram.

## Features
- Etalon cardiocycle modeling: you can manually change the symmetry, time location, extremum point and amplitude of each wave of etalon.
- Electrocardiogram builer: you can build ECG with given number of cycles, set alternation of **T wave**, set power of noise wich will applied on builded ECG.
- Signal filters
  - exponential filter
  - moving average filter
  - adaptive filter
  
- Beautiful interface
- Several interface color styles
